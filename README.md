# TutorWeb
A website developed using the MEN stack, it helps in connecting a student to a tutor through our explore option and giving local tutors a platform to expand their businesses online. It also provides a payment gateway(testing environment) for easy payments. The website has two modes, student mode to browse through local workshops and classes and tutor mode to add a new workshop or course.
